Japan Tourism Analysis Project
üìñ Project Overview
This project analyzes international tourism data for Japan to identify key trends in visitor demographics. The primary goal is to determine the top countries for inbound tourism and visualize the global distribution of visitors. This analysis provides insights into which regions are most significant for Japan's tourism industry.

üìä Key Visualizations
Interactive World Map of Visitors
A key output of this project is an interactive choropleth map. It provides a global overview of visitor numbers, with richer colors indicating a higher number of tourists.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core language used for the analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static visualizations like bar charts and pie charts.

Plotly: For creating the interactive choropleth world map.

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: As the environment for developing and presenting the analysis.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This Project
To reproduce this analysis, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly).

Open the .ipynb notebook file in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.

Run the cells in the notebook sequentially. The CSV_1_2_2_.CSV file is included in the repository and will be loaded by the notebook.

üìà Key Findings
European Dominance: The analysis reveals that European countries constitute the largest group of visitors in this dataset.

Top Source Countries: France, Spain, and the USA are the top three countries for inbound tourism to Japan based on this data.

Tiered Distribution: The majority of countries fall into the "Tier 3" category, indicating that a relatively small number of countries are responsible for a large portion of visitors.
